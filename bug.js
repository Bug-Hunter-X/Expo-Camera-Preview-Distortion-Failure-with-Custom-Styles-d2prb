This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` component with custom styles.  If you apply styles that affect the aspect ratio of the camera preview (e.g., setting `width` and `height` directly, or using flexbox with incorrect `aspectRatio`), the preview might become distorted or the camera might fail to function correctly.  This is especially problematic on devices with different screen resolutions and aspect ratios. The camera might show a black screen, a distorted image, or simply not initialize.
