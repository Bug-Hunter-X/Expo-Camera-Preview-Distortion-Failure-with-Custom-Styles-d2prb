Here's how to fix the issue:

Instead of setting fixed width and height, utilize the `aspectRatio` prop of the Expo Camera component.  This ensures that the preview maintains the correct aspect ratio regardless of the device's screen dimensions.

**Incorrect (may cause issues):**
```javascript
<View style={{ width: 300, height: 400 }}>
  <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} />
</View>
```

**Correct:**
```javascript
<Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} ratio={'16:9'}/>
```

If you must use flexbox, make sure the parent container's aspect ratio is correctly set to maintain the desired camera preview aspect ratio. You can achieve this by setting the aspect ratio of the parent container to match the camera's aspect ratio, or using a flexbox layout where the aspect ratio is implicitly maintained.

**Example with Flexbox:**
```javascript
<View style={{ flex: 1, aspectRatio: 16/9 }}>
  <Camera style={{ flex: 1 }} />
</View>
```
This ensures that the parent view maintains a consistent aspect ratio, preventing distortion of the camera preview.
