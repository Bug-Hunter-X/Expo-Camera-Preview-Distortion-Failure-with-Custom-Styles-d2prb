# Expo Camera Preview Issue with Custom Styling

This repository demonstrates a bug in the Expo `Camera` component where applying custom styles that affect the aspect ratio can lead to preview distortion or failure. The issue is more pronounced on devices with varied screen aspect ratios. 

## Problem Description
When applying custom styles (e.g., setting fixed width and height or using flexbox without proper aspect ratio handling) to the Expo Camera component, the camera preview might be distorted, show a black screen, or entirely fail to initialize.  This inconsistency arises across different device screen sizes and aspect ratios. 

## Solution
The solution involves carefully managing the aspect ratio of the Camera component's container.  Avoid directly setting `width` and `height` and instead use the `aspectRatio` prop of the Camera component or ensure that flexbox is used correctly to maintain the desired aspect ratio.
